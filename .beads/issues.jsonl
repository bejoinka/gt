Disabled choices (greyed out)\n- Typewriter effect in progress\n\n### Encounter Overlay\n```tsx\n// src/components/encounter/EncounterOverlay.tsx\ninterface EncounterOverlayProps {\n  encounter: AgentEncounter;\n  currentStep: EncounterStep;\n  onChoice: (choice: string) =\u003e void;\n  onDocumentInspect: () =\u003e void;\n}\n```\n\n**States to test:**\n- Declaration phase (no choices)\n- Choice phase (4-6 options)\n- Document inspection mode\n- Resolution phase\n\n### Document Display\n```tsx\n// src/components/encounter/DocumentDisplay.tsx\ninterface DocumentDisplayProps {\n

workersRemoved: WorkerId[];\n}\n```\n\n**States to test:**\n- Good day (all positive)\n- Bad day (worker removed)\n- Mixed day\n- Oregon Trail-style progress bars\n\n## Component Testing Strategy\n\nEach component should have a corresponding test file with state previews:\n\n```tsx\n// src/components/shop/FlavorRoster.test.tsx\nimport { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport { FlavorRoster } from './FlavorRoster';\n\ndescribe('FlavorRoster', () =\u003e {\n  const testStates = {\n    allPresent: {\n      workers: [...allSixWorkers],\n

chocolate],\n      featuredFlavor: 'vanilla',\n    },\n  };\n  \n  it('renders all workers when present', () =\u003e {\n    render(\u003cFlavorRoster {...testStates.allPresent} /\u003e);\n    expect(screen.getAllByRole('listitem')).toHaveLength(6);\n  });\n  \n  it('shows gone styling for removed workers', () =\u003e {\n    render(\u003cFlavorRoster {...testStates.oneRemoved} /\u003e);\n    expect(screen.getByText('GONE')).toBeInTheDocument();\n  });\n});\n```\n\n## File Structure\n```\nsrc/components/\n├── shop/\n│   ├── PowerUpSlots.tsx\n│   ├── CustomerQueue.tsx\n│   ├──

corners only (no rounded)\n- Banded colors (no gradients)\n- Pixel fonts (Press Start 2P/VT323)\n- Touch targets minimum 44px\n- Grid-aligned layouts\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All 6 zone components implemented\n- [ ] All overlay components implemented\n- [ ] Each component has test file with state previews\n- [ ] Pixel art styling applied (no rounded corners, no gradients)\n- [ ] Color palette imported from `types/colors.ts` (no hardcoded colors)\n- [ ] Touch targets verified (44px minimum)\n- [ ] Components render at 360×640 without scroll\n\n## Dependencies\n**BLOCKS ON:** \n- TYPE-Foundation (need types)\n- SETUP-Base (need React + Tailwind set up)\n\n## Notes\n- Consider adding Storybook later for visual testing\n- For now, use test files with different state snapshots\n- Use CSS Grid for the main layout (6 zones)\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"jonathan@awellhealth.com","created_at":"2026-01-18T19:33:25.310009-05:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-01-18T20:14:27.643396-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-18T20:14:27.643396-05:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["components","ui"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"icecream-55m","depends_on_id":"icecream-86x","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-18T19:34:19.10095-05:00","created_by":"mayor"},{"issue_id":"icecream-55m","depends_on_id":"icecream-9v3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-18T19:34:19.202578-05:00","created_by":"mayor"}]}
